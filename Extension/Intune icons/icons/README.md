# Placeholder Icon

This file is a placeholder for the actual icon image file (PNG format).

For your extension, you'll need to create the following icon sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can replace these placeholder files with your actual icon images.
